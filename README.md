Design choices:
Typography:
The fonts chosen were inspiered by tron 'Orbitron' for the headings and Roboto' for the text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively.

'teko' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel. The strong style generally feels more sturdy and standouts. 'Lato' is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the teko whilst being easy to read for all.

Colour Scheme:
